# Training and Deployment
The Number Plate model has been trained in Roboflow, and available for inference on the Dataset tab.
One could also build a Automatic Number Plate Recognition [ANPR] App using YOLOR and EasyOCR. This is achieved using the Roboflow Platform which you can deploy the model for robust and real-time ANPR.
